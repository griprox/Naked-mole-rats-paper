Firstly, all necessary python libraries need to be installed.
We recommend using virtualenv (https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html)
After virtualenv is installed, an instance of virtual environment should be created for the project by running
"virtualenv envname", where envname is the name you choose.
Activate your virtual environment with "source envname/bin/activate"
Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install python dependencies
Run "pip install notebook"  to install Jupyter Notebook
After this, your environment should be set. Each time you want to run code from this project,
 you must activate your virtual environment with "source envname/bin/activate".

Next, you will need to access data and models here

You should unzip folders "data" and "models" in the root directory of the project, next to "src/", "notebooks/" etc.

When you run the code for the project for the first time, run the setup script (remember, virtualenv should be active)
with "python setup_paths.py data" where "data" is the name of the data folder (by default, it should be just "data").
